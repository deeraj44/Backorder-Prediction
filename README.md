Overview:  
This project follows a comprehensive data science workflow aimed at producing robust and accurate predictions. The dataset used for this project contains over 1 million observations, providing a rich source of information to work with. The process includes key stages such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering and selection, and the development of a machine learning model from scratch. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard was built to visualize key insights and model predictions in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
